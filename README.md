# 🏞️ Places Classification using CNN

A deep learning project that classifies different environmental scenes like **mountain, forest, sea, street, glacier, and buildings** using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow and Keras.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on image datasets of various places.  
The model learns to recognize features unique to each class — for example:
- 🌲 Forests have dense greenery and texture patterns.
- 🏔️ Mountains have sharp edges and rocky structures.
- 🌊 Seas have wave patterns and blue hues.
- 🏙️ Buildings and streets have man-made geometric patterns.
- 🧊 Glaciers have icy tones and reflective surfaces.

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
The CNN model includes:
- **Conv2D layers** for feature extraction  
- **MaxPooling2D** for dimensionality reduction  
- **Dense layers** for classification  
- **Softmax activation** for multi-class prediction  

Frameworks used:
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Streamlit (for web interface)
